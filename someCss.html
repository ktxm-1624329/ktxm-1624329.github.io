			<p><div class="a">Hi! My name is Mai. I am fourth year student studying public health. Some fun facts about me is that I moved to the U.S with my family when I was 12 years old. I have a brother who is 5 years younger than me. Also, I can speak three different languages.</div><p>
			<p><div class="b">On my free time I like to relax, watch movies, listen to music and hang out with my friends. This is my first time taking an Info class, it's very different from the usual social science/public health classes that I have taken. There are a lot I don't know about informatics like writing HTML, however, I find that this class i really interesting and it push me to learn new skills.</div><p>
